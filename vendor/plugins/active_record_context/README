ActiveRecordContext
===================

Simple ActiveRecord context for caching AR objects.  It caches all records from #find queries
that aren't readonly, and that don't have eagerly loaded associations. It only looks in the context
on simple Foo.find(id) queries with no conditions.  It's designed to work as an alternative to eager
loading associations.  It will also help all the extra find calls for models that access their associations
in callbacks/validations.

It only uses the context when it's activated.  To activate, you can set a controller around_filter:

  around_filter :set_context
  
  def set_context
    ActiveRecord::Base.with_context do
      yield
    end
  end
  
Set Technoweenie::ActiveRecordContext.log_context_activity = true to turn on debug logging.
